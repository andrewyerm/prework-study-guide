# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My main motivation was that once we can learn to make a website like this, we will be able to branch out into so many unique projects in the future.
- I built this project so that I would be able to learn and apply the foundational basics of web development.
- This project helps students to keep their notes for class organized.
- I learned how to explore and navigate files through terminal, how to set up the frame with HTML, create shapes and styles with CSS, and bring functionality to the site with JavaScript. This was an awesome project and I truly learned a lot!
